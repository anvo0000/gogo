I. Common Measures of Vector Similarity
1. Cosine Similarity (A,B):
    Range from -1 to 1:
        1 => vectors are identical in direction => best match. 
       -1 => vectors are opposed, representing the worst match. 
        0 => vectors are completely dissimilar in terms of direction. 
    sample: 
        cat and cat [[1.00]]
        cat and lion [[0.50700581]]
        cat and shark [[0.32073223]]
        shark and banana [[0.24036745]]
